# Welcome to MyVacation!

Our website was created to make traveling easy. We had several experiences where we forget to bring an item with us or didn't have time to visit other websites to see what entertainment the location you are visiting has to offer. For that reason we created MyVacation. A place where you can plan your dream vacation. 

## Getting Started
In order to visit our website, you must sign in or create an account. When you have successfully done that you are taken to the home page where you can start creating a vacation by clicking 'create new vacation', in which you would provide a title and description. From there you can select the vacation you just created to be able to add a todo list and places you wish to see. There is also, a favorite selection, you can add all the places you liked so you don't forget for the future.
